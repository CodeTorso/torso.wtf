# Mindset for Jobs in Tech

You have heard it all. Blogging, open-sourcing, networking, contributing, and participating can get you a job. But these things only contribute to the 30% of you getting the job. The rest 70% is the skills you have, mistakes you made, and the learnings you got. Many starters don't look at that thing.

They get into DevOps thinking of the big numbers. When they start to learn it, they give up - easily destroyed by some of the difficult topics. There is no shortcut in life. You need to put those hours in until you get the result.

You think of earning, but not about how you'll get there. Your goal should not be to get that income. But to be that person who is made for that income. You need to create that value within yourself.

Remember, Motivation will only stick to the point when what you are learning is just slightly above your current understanding. Many people underestimate this thing. You need to build up to that level until which the hard topics are just slightly above your head.

Money should not be the driving thing. Curiosity should be. Find the thing that suits you. The community that accepts you that helps you grow. Explore different fields. Tech is a world in itself. Find your place in it. When you would have find that then put those hours into it. It would be easy for you to learn that, since your behavior and characters match with it.

Always remember certain fields will always be there with those massive cash. But remember that Mastery earns the highest always.

I do not believe my analogy is the best, it's my own thoughts. Suggest your ideas, thoughts, beliefs or even your own journey in the comments.
