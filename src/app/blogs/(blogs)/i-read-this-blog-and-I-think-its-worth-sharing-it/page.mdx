# I read this blog and I think it's worth sharing it

So, last month, I was building the frontend part of supermemory.ai, much of my time was spent on making the editor and canvas, which as of writing this blog is still not complete. But it was so fun writing

```
import type { Metadata } from "next";

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: "Blog / @CodeTorso",
  description: "I love writing.",
};

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
    <header className="min-h-screen bg-black text-white px-6">{children}</header>
  );
}
```
