# A Challenge

Two days ago, one of frined friend DMed me on Twitter about a freelance job he had. It was an Electron application based on Next.js, which I later convinced him to switch to Vite. He offered me $80 to $150 for about two weeks of work. I've been in tech since 2022 but had never made money from it before. This was my first dollar. The catch? I had never used Electron. Still, I said yes, and surprisingly, I got the job done in just two days.

I've also seen some of my friends make money from SaaS projects, which got me thinking: why shouldn't I give it a try? I'm still in high school, with college coming up next year. There's a college entrance exam called JEE that I should be preparing for, but I'm not. So, I figured, why not use this time to create content, build apps, and do some freelancing?

But saying it won't make it happen. We need a target and a system. My goal is to earn $2,000 by January 2025. Half of which I am going to donate. That seems like the best motivation for me. But to achieve this, I need a plan.

To hold myself accountable, I've decided to post tweets and make a YouTube video every day. I have some SaaS ideas, but beyond that, not much. Do I know potential clients who might need my skills? No. Do I have a good reach? Not really. My 350 followers are about 60% bots. But I do have some belief in myself. So bye.
