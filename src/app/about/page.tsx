              I&apos;m just an ordinary teenager currently living in India. My first
              exposure to programming came in 2019 when I learned about C++ in
              school. I built a simple calculator on my phone and proudly showed
              it to everyoneâ€”and that was it for the time.

              In November of 2021, I got my first laptop, which opened up new
              possibilities. I really got into programming in 2022,
              dedicating two hours every day after school to learning. However,
              due to my board exams that year, I had to put my coding
              dreams on hold for another year.
            </p>

              From 2023 onwards, I had two years of relative freedom to explore
              and create. During this time, I delved into various areas such as
              Chrome extension development and web programming. Through these
              experiences, I discovered my passion for building things. Since
              then, the journey has been incredibly rewarding and exciting.
